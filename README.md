# TimeWall is a graph database
> It be used to apply mathematic model and social network with graph algorithms and so on...

## Features:
```
1. C/S structure
2. compute in memory
3. dynamic add and remove nodes on the graph db
4. with lots of algorithms of graph
5. opensource
```

Think about there's an app you apply it to app store, more and more people download it.
Social network is an important feature of your app;
Users of app follow each other through adding count.
There's the questions:
1. how to ognaize the network links of your app users ?
2. how to get the users follower and follwing ?
3. if user A follow B and B follow C, how to know the relationship between A and C.

Besides, timewall can be also used to other fields:

1. how to prove the `Six degrees of separation theory` with a better way ?
2. actually you can simulate a body, trate each node as cell on animals.
3. on astronomy, node also be the plant.
